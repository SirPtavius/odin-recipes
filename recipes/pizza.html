        <p>Of Neapolitan pizza there is only one with immediately recognizable characteristics, to the eye and to the palate:</p>
        <ul> 
         <li>the <b>high, crisp edge,</b> just like bread</li>
         <li>the blood red <b>tomato</b></li>
         <li><b>evo oil</b> in a perfect emulsion</li>
         <li><b>fresh basil</b></li>
         <li>the <b>melted mozzarella</b></li>
        </ul>
        <p>These are the "few and simple" ingredients that make up the recipe for true Neapolitan pizza, not one more, not one less.</p>
        <p>It all sounds very easy, doesn't it? Yet it isn't!</p>
        <p>Because to make a Neapolitan pizza as tradition dictates, you need top-quality ingredients, certainly, but you also need skilled hands, experience, professionalism. These are all things that are acquired over the years thanks to a wealth of work experience that adds up to a base of high-level professional training.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients List</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>brewer's yeast</li>
            <li>Wheat flour 0</li>
            <li>Whole-wheat flours from different sources (depending on taste)</li>
            <li>pulp of peeled tomatoes (freshly prepared)</li>
            <li>fior di latte or buffalo mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>fresh basil</li>
            <li>evo oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix the brewer's yeast into the water, which must be at room temperature; then, that mixture of water and yeast should be added flush to the flour mix, trying to incorporate it gently to avoid lumps.</li>
            <li>The dough should then be put to rise inside a large bowl covered with a cloth for as long as necessary (at least 10 hours); after that, the dough should be broken into buns, rolled out into a regular ball and left to rest for another 8 hours to conclude the pizza rising process.</li>
            <li>At this point, the Neapolitan pizza dough loaf is ready: it should be rolled out on a floured surface in the classic motion starting from the center and going outward.</li>
            <li>Add the topping of your choise</li>
            <li>Bake the pizza in a wood-fired oven at a temperature of 500 degrees</li>
            
        </ol>
