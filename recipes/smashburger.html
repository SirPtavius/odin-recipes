    <p>A homemade Smash Burger is quick and easy to make. These fly off the grill in minutes so it’s a great way to feed a crowd</p>
    <p>Smash burgers have the iconic flavor profile of classic Burgers, but that double burger patty with cheese melted in between is irresistible and you’ll love the special sauce.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients for Smash Burgers</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Ground Beef - We use 1.5 lbs of 80/20 beef to make 4 double-patty burgers, but you can easily scale the recipe up to feed a crowd (use 3 lbs for 8 double-patty burgers).</li>
        <li>Sauce - A simple combination of mayo and yellow mustard is what we use to grill and assemble the burgers.</li>
        <li>Cheese - we love thick-sliced medium cheddar cheese for burgers, but you can use American-style cheese or your favorite sliced cheese.</li>
        <li>Topping of your choise - Buns, lettuce, pickles, tomato, red onion</li>       
    </ol>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare Patties - Divide 1 1/2 lbs of ground beef into 8 equal portions (3 oz each), cover, and refrigerate until ready to cook.</li>
        <li>Make Sauce - Stir together 1/3 cup mayo and 1 tsp mustard and set aside.</li>
        <li>Prep Toppings - fully prep your toppings ahead to assemble the burgers right away while the patties are hot and juicy off the grill.</li>
        <li>Toast buns - lightly butter the cut side of your buns and toast on a griddle or skillet over medium heat until golden brown. Transfer to a rack.</li>
        <li>Cook patties - increase to medium-high heat. Depending on your surface area, place 2 to 4 cold pieces of meat onto the hot surface. Working quickly, cover each piece with a sheet of parchment paper and smash each into a thin patty. Remove parchment paper, season with salt, pepper, and garlic powder, add a dab of sauce, and flip. Sear for 2 minutes on the first side and about a minute on the second side.</li>
        <li>Add cheese - place a slice of cheese onto half of the patties and top with a second patty and remove from heat. Serve warm over toasted buns with toppings.</li>
